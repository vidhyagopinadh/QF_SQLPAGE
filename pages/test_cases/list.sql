-- Page to manage Test Cases for a Suite

-- ============================================================
-- STEP 1: All SET + REDIRECT logic BEFORE any component output
-- ============================================================

-- AUTO AI GENERATION: Only redirect to generate if a specific suite is selected
-- and that suite has no real test cases yet
